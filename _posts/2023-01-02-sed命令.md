sed 命令是流编辑器，处理时，把当前处理的行存储到临时缓冲区中，称为“模式空间”（pattern space），接着用 sed 命令处理缓冲区中的内容，处理完成后，把缓冲区的内容输出到终端，然后处理下一行，这样不断重复，直到文件末尾。文件内容不会改变，除非使用重定向存储输出。

sed 命令处理文本时以行为单位。

# sed 常用内部命令

创建两个文本文件，test.txt，内容如下：
>this is first line.
>this is second line.
>this is third line.
>
>this is fifth line
>My favorite os is linux

test2.txt，内容如下：
>Apple is my favorite,Huawei is his favorite,Apple is her favorite.
Joe's favorite is Apple.

## a，追加
append，追加操作

在第5行下面增加一行
```console
[uphie@node01 ~]$ sed '5a this is sixth line.' test.txt
this is first line.
this is second line.
this is third line.

this is fifth line
this is sixth line.
My favorite os is linux
```

在以 `fifth line` 结尾的行下面添加 `Happy New Year`：
```console
[uphie@node01 ~]$ sed '/fifth line$/a Happy New Year' test.txt
this is first line.
this is second line.
this is third line.

this is fifth line
Happy New Year
My favorite os is linux
```

## i，插入

```console
[uphie@node01 ~]$ sed '6i this is 6th line' test.txt
this is first line.

```

## d，删除
delete，删除操作

利用正则 `^$` 删除空行：
```console
[uphie@node01 ~]$ sed '/^$/d' test.txt
this is first line.
this is second line.
this is third line.
this is fifth line
My favorite os is linux
```

删除第 n 行：
```console
[uphie@node01 ~]$ sed '1d' test.txt
this is second line.
this is third line.

this is fifth line

```

删除第 m 到 n 行：
```console
[uphie@node01 ~]$ sed '1,3d' test.txt

this is fifth line

## r，读文件

```

使用正则匹配到的结果使用&表示：
```console
[uphie@node01 ~]$ echo I love linux | sed 's/\w\+/[&]/g'
[I] [love] [linux]
```

使用正则匹配到的结果的子串按顺序使用序号表示，如 `\1`，`\2` ...
